# Changelog

0.13.3 (Aug 31, 2016)
-----

#### Fixes:

- Fixed `lodash.isequal` import, which was ruined by case-insensitive HFS+ *shakes fist*

0.13.2 (Aug 31, 2016)
-----

#### Fixes:

- Diffing children in order to regenerate the layout now diffs the `key` props and their order.
  - This will catch more changes, such as sorting, addition, and removal.
- Only pass `className` and `style` to WidthProvider. Other props were not intended to be supported.
  - I'm aware this could be a breaking change if you were relying on this bad behavior. If so, please
    use your own `WidthProvider`-style HOC.
- `babel-plugin-transform-flow-comments` had limited support for defining types like transpiled classes.
  - This has been updated to instead copy source to `.js.flow` files, which preserves all type information.

0.13.1 (Aug 16, 2016)
-----

#### Fixes:

- Fix remaining `propTypes` warnings.

0.13.0 (Aug 3, 2016)
-----

#### Changed:

- Due to a change in React 15.2, passing the `_grid` property on DOM children generates an error.
  To compensate, we now error on the same and suggest using `data-grid` instead. Simply change any use of
  `_grid` to `data-grid`, or add your properties to the layout.

#### Fixes:

- Fix React 15.3 warning re: propTypes.

0.12.7 (Jun 29, 2016)
-----

- Prevent extraenous rerenders in `<ResponsiveReactGridLayout>` by using deep equality on layouts.

0.12.6 (Jun 5, 2016)
-----

- Fix blindingly obvious bug where mounted isn't set to true. Smack forehead.

0.12.5 (Jun 3, 2016)
-----

- Fixes for server rendering checksum failures.

0.12.4 (May 22, 2016)
-----

- Update to React-Draggable v2. Fixes: #241, #239, #24
  - v2 contains a number of bugfixes & enhancements for touchscreens, multitouch, and scrolling containers.

0.12.3 (May 3, 2016)
-----

- Bugfix: Rendering with new `breakpoints`/`cols` does not refresh the layout.
  Fixes #208 - thanks @damienleroux

0.12.2 (May 1, 2016)
------

- Bugfix: Fix warning about undefined `useCSSTransforms` when server-rendering.

0.12.1 (Apr 19, 2016)
------

- Bugfix: Don't set `layout` twice on width change. See #217 - thanks @damienleroux
- Enhancement: Add Flow type comments

0.12.0 (Apr 14, 2016)
------

- `<ReactGridLayout>` will no longer animate so severely on mount. See #212.
  - If you are using `<WidthProvider>`, you may notice that the container's width still shunts on mount.
    If you like, you may delay mounting by setting `measureBeforeMount={true}` on the wrapped element. This
    will eliminate the mounting animation completely.
  - If you enjoyed the old animation, set `useCSSTransforms={this.state.mounted}` and toggle the mounting
    flag. See `0-showcase.jsx` for an example.
- Set more permissive version ranges for `<Draggable>` and `<Resizable>` dependencies, as they are now stable
  and will only introduce breaking changes on major version ticks.

0.11.3 (Apr 8, 2016)
------

- Officially support React v15.

0.11.2 (Apr 6, 2016)
------

- Bugfix: Draggable cancel selectors, see #203 - thanks @RiiD
- README fixes, thanks @bravo-kernel & @ro-savage

0.11.1
------

- Bugfix: `<ResponsiveReactGridLayout>` was using stale data when synchronizing children with the layout
  on a breakpoint change.

0.11.0
------

This release contains potentially breaking changes so I have updated the minor version (as per semver).

**Breaking Changes**:

- Layout items now have a fixed set of properties. Other properties will *not* be merged into the `<GridItem>`, such
  as `className`. To set a `className` on a child, set it on the child directly and it will be merged.
  This allows us to make better assumptions about the layout and use a faster cloning mechanism.
- Setting individual `handle` and `cancel` selectors per item is no longer supported. If you need this, please
  open a ticket and let me know your use case.

Other changes:

- Bugfix: `<ResponsiveReactGridLayout>` `onLayoutChange` callback data could still be stale.
- Bugfix: Range error when building layout solely from `_grid` properties.
  - This broke a lot of usage and thus `0.10.11` and `0.10.10` have been unpublished.
- Removed redundant `isPlaceholder` property from `<GridItem>`.
- README updates to clarify layout/_grid usage.

0.10.11
-------

- Bugfix: `layouts` param on `<ResponsiveReactGridLayout>`'s `onLayoutChange` could have stale data
  for the current breakpoint.

0.10.10
-------

- Performance: Prevent V8 deopt in a few methods and add fast layout item cloning.

0.10.9
------

- Bugfix: Typo in children comparison in CWRP. See #169.
- Bugfix: Missing babel-preset-es2015 in dev.

0.10.8
------

- Rebuild using [ES2015 Loose Mode](https://babeljs.algolia.com/docs/advanced/loose/).

0.10.7
------

- Bugfix: `className` and `style` props on grid children were being incorrectly dropped, a holdover
  from when `cloneWithProps()` used to do this merging for us. They are now merged.

0.10.6
------

- Bugfix: If both `props.layout` and `props.children.length` change in the same tick,
  props.layout would be clobbered. See #162

0.10.5
------

- Bugfix/Enhancement: Margins were causing subtle error in some of the positioning calculations. This has
  been fixed.

0.10.4
------

- Bugfix: Container height was calculated as less than expected due to improper addition of margin.

0.10.3
------

- Bugfix: Round item positions even if they're currently resizing or dragging (#158, regression of #141)
- Bugfix: Fix a positioning bug when margins are 0 (#160)

0.10.2
------

- Bugfix: <RGL> would synchronize children with layout if the layout in props didn't match the state;
  this was meant to be a hook for the developer to supply a new layout. The incorrect check could cause the
  layout to reset if the parent rerendered. The check is now between the layout in nextProps and props.
- Bugfix: Fixed a lot of resizing layout bugs; most of the fixes are in react-resizable.
- Bugfix: Fixed incorrect typecheck on LayoutItem.i.
- Bugfix: Make onLayoutChange fire appropriately (#155).
- Bugfix: Fix `<ResponsiveGridLayout>` not properly reverting when sizing the page up (#154).
- Remove unused `offsetX` and `offsetY` from layouts.
- Dependency updates.

0.10.1
------

- Hotfix for default export incompatibility caused by Babel 6.

0.10.0
------

This long-awaited release provides React 0.14 compatibility and a rewrite of the underlying
`<Draggable>` functionality.

**Breaking changes:**

- `ListensToWidth` replaced with `WidthProvider` which must wrap
  `<ResponsiveReactGridLayout>` and `<ReactGridLayout>` to provide width data. See doc for example.
- Prop `initialWidth` renamed to `width`.
- Grid Layout keys must be type of string now.

Other changes:

- *Finally* compatible with React 0.14! Big thanks to @menelike for his help.
- Upgraded to Babel 6.
- Full typechecking via Flow.
- Lots of misc bugfixes.
  - See beta releases below for more details.

  copy the rules from css/styles.css into your stylesheet.
